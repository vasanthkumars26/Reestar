Project Showcase: Reestar – A Simple Food Web Application 🍽️

I’ve built a basic food web application named Reestar using HTML and CSS. It features three main pages:

🏠 Home

🍲 Recipe

📞 Contact

Each page is fully functional and linked for smooth navigation.

At the bottom of every page, you’ll find a Food Instruction Form in the footer where users can submit their details or cooking instructions. The interface is clean and user-friendly, with a few interactive touches like hover effects on navigation links and buttons for a more engaging experience.

Reestar was built purely with basic HTML and CSS, showcasing how much you can achieve with just the fundamentals. More features and responsiveness will be added in future updates.

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions! 🌟
